# Landing Page Challenge


## Footnote
When I started this homework I thought that you had to copy the iamge that they give you and found out that you
didn't have to lol. I still decided to stick with that design style since I was already to far in to start over anyway.
I think I got close enough to it, but with some modifications. I also ran out of time, and just needed something to turn in.

## Also Note
I hope the images work. My pc for some reason only likes the full file path instead of the relative one.

## Use
This page will be where I post links to my projects in the future. The links only have placeholders for now just to get them working.

## Tools
VS Code, HTML, CSS

##  Updates
I will updating this site regulary especially as I learn more foundation and syntax.

## Images
I totally forgot to get the links for the images to give credit where credit is due. Will have to go back and search them again later.

## License
Just a MIT license. It's only a basic website for now. May update license in the future.
